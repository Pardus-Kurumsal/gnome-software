For GNOME 3.10:
 * Aim for feature parity with gnome-packagekit
 * Focus on update experience
 * Always update offline (including security updates)
 * Never wait on downloads in the application
 * Search for available applications
 * May not have screenshots, ratings and other metadata for the installation part
 * The only metadata we absolutely want to have is icons


gnome-software is split into a service, gnome-software-service, and
a launcher, gnome-software. Normally, the service is autostarted at
login to monitor available updates, and the laucher will simply call 
into the service and cause it to open a window.

During development, you can kill the currently running instance of
the service, and lauch your version manually:

  killall gnome-software-service
  ./src/gnome-software-service

To open a window, you can run the launcher in another terminal, e.g.:

  gnome-software --search fox
